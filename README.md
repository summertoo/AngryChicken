# Angry Chicken 🐔🎯

> A Web3 physics puzzle game built on **Sui blockchain** with **Walrus decentralized storage** — slingshot chickens to destroy structures and defeat bugs, with on-chain NFT skins, level pack passes, a community level marketplace, and a standalone **AI Agent** for managing Walrus-published levels and market data.

## 🎮 Overview

Angry Chicken reimagines the classic slingshot puzzle genre as a **fully on-chain Web3 game**. Players launch chickens from a slingshot to smash through wooden, brick, and stone structures, taking down enemy bugs. The game integrates deeply with the **Sui network** (testnet) and uses **Walrus** for decentralized level storage.

## ⛓️ Sui Blockchain Integration

### Smart Contract (`game.move`)

A Sui Move contract deployed on **Sui Testnet** powers all game economies:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **NFT Chicken Skins** | `ChickenSkin` objects with rendering parameters (color, pattern, eyes, accessories, rarity) — minted via crafting or blind boxes |
| **Skin Blind Boxes** | `SkinBox` objects — randomized skin drops using epoch-seeded pseudo-randomness |
| **Level Pack Passes** | `LevelPackPass` objects gate premium levels (21+); each pass unlocks 10 levels |
| **Community Level Marketplace** | `UserLevel` objects store level metadata; users publish, browse, rate, and purchase play access to community-created levels |
| **Treasury** | All v2 payment flows send SUI to a fixed on-chain beneficiary address |

**Contract details:**
- **Package ID (testnet):** `0xaaf917ee09c8359c09a716a0665e1d42d90c02597e5508115aa67e5a0d981481`
- **Language:** Sui Move (edition `2024.beta`)
- **Module:** `crazych_game::game`

### Sui SDK

Built with `@mysten/sui` v1.45.2 and `@mysten/wallet-standard` for:
- **Wallet connectivity** — dynamic detection of wallet-standard compliant Sui wallets (fallback to legacy `window.suiWallet`)
- **Transaction building & execution** — all gas payments in SUI (testnet)
- **On-chain queries** — owned objects (skins, passes), published levels, events

### On-Chain Economy

| Action | Cost (SUI) |
|--------|-----------|
| Skin Blind Box | 0.1 SUI |
| Skin Crafting | 0.3 SUI |
| Level Pack Pass (10 levels) | 0.1 SUI |
| Preset Skins (Shop) | 1–2 SUI |

## 🗄️ Walrus Decentralized Storage

[**Walrus**](https://walrus.trade) provides **decentralized blob storage** for all user-generated level data:

- **Level Upload** — Level JSON configurations are uploaded to the Walrus publisher at `https://publisher.walrus-testnet.walrus.space/v1/blobs`
- **Level Download** — Levels are fetched from the Walrus aggregator at `https://aggregator.walrus-testnet.walrus.space/v1/blobs` using a `blobId`
- **Blob → On-Chain Linking** — The Walrus `blobId` is recorded on Sui via `publish_level`, creating a permanent link between storage and blockchain
- **Shared URLs** — Levels can be shared directly via `?blob=<blobId>` URL parameters

This architecture keeps game data **immutable, decentralized, and verifiable** while leveraging Sui for ownership, access control, and payments.
